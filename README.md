# generalization-ability-of-classifier-based-defenses
quantitatively measure how well classifier defenses perform on known vs. unseen attacks.  We compare two pipelines: A TF-IDF + Logistic Regression classifier   A BERT-based semantic classifier   And our focus is specifically on the F1 performance drop between familiar and unfamiliar attacks.
